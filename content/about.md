Hi, my name is Magnus!

I am a master student in Electrical Engineering at DTU - Technical University of Denmark. I have a bachelor in Earth and Space Physics and Engineering, also from DTU.
My main professional interest is space technologies, especially satellite hardware and software,  electronics, signal processing, and remote sensing technologies.
