Hi!

I'm My name is Magnus, and I'm a master student in Electrical Engineering at DTU - Technical University of Denmark. I also have a bachelor in Earth and Space Physics and Engineering from DTU. My professional curiosity has me interested in all kinds of topics, but my bread and butter is electronics, space, and mathematics.

I have many hobby interests competing for my attention in my free time. I've been a scout for most of my life, and I enjoy spending time in nature and going on hikes.

## About the site

I built this website myself using Hugo, a static website generator. I wrote the HTML templates used by Hugo myself, and rely on the Bulma CSS framework for most of the styling.

It is hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) in Helsinki, Finland, which I rent from Hetzner.
The server OS is Ubuntu, and it runs an Apache webserver that I configured, which is serving this website.
It only talks over secure HTTPS connections, and has a certificate from Let's Encrypt that automatically gets renewed.
