Hi!

I'm My name is Magnus, and I'm a master student in Electrical Engineering at DTU - Technical University of Denmark. I also have a bachelor in Earth and Space Physics and Engineering from DTU.

## About the site

I built this website myself using Hugo, a static website generator. I wrote the HTML templates used by Hugo myself, and rely on the Bulma CSS framework for most of the styling.

{{< figure src="/img/logo.png" alt="Website logo" caption="I used a sinc function as the website logo, which I plotted in MATLAB." width="256px" >}}

It is hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) in Helsinki, Finland, which I rent from Hetzner.
The server OS is Ubuntu, and it runs an Apache webserver that I configured, which is serving this website.
It only talks over secure HTTPS connections, and has a certificate from Let's Encrypt that automatically gets renewed.
