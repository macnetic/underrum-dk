I am going to try and put my maps on this website. For now I have only managed to do the quickstart for Leaflet.

I will need to expand the Hugo shorthand for creating maps. Probably with a reference to the script that generates the map.
That would allow for the fullest customizability, while still making it easy to put in a new map.

I also need to figure out how to export maps from QGIS to leaflet. There is a QGIS plugin called *qgis2web* that supposedly
can export to a Leaflet-readable output.

{{< leafletmap id="cph" height="480px" >}}
