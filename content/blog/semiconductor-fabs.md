## Introduction

So I spent a lot of time compiling this list of semiconductor fabrication plants.
I need it for a project that I'm hoping to post here as well, and I was not comfortable using the
[list&nbsp;on&nbsp;Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_semiconductor_fabrication_plants)
which, although more complete in some ways, is lacking sources, and didn't contain all the information I need.

Maybe someone else will find this information useful, so I am publishing it here, with sources, for free.
I am considering updating the Wikipedia page to match, but for the time being this live here until I can find the time
to do it.

## The data

Japan Semiconductor is a subsidiary of Toshiba Electronic Devices & Storage Corporation which runs the Japanese fabrication plants.
They interestingly highlight their parallel production-capable dual-fab framework as strength against natural disasters.

## Notes

* Semiconductor manufacturing is divided into:
  * Front end manufacturing – fabrication of microchips on wafer
    * <https://www.a-m-c.com/experience/industries/semiconductor/front-end-semiconductor-manufacturing/>
    * Many steps
  * Back end manufacturing – post-processing of completed wafers
    * <https://www.a-m-c.com/experience/industries/semiconductor/back-end-semiconductor-manufacturing/>
    * Inspection
    * Probing
    * Dicing
    * Die bond
    * Wire bond, or
    * Solder bond / Flip chip
    * Encapsulation
* Fabs can be classified by e.g.
  * Production nodes
  * Wafer size
  * Capacity
